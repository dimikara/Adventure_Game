# Adventure Game
A simple version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game, done in Python.
Part of the projects for the Intro to Programming Nanodegree (2020) by Udacity.

## Description

This is only a very short game with a couple of choices available to the player. This was done on purpose, to keep it simple. If we were making a complete game, we would expand it a great deal, and probably give the player a whole world to explore. But for this project, the idea is to focus on some key things that we need if we want to make a working game:

- The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
- Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
- The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
- The game has conditions for winning and losing.
- When the game is over, it asks the player if they want to play again.
